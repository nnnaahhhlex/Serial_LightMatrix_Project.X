OE Bar = Grounded (Low)
SRCLR Bar = low -> clear shift register 

SER = Data input. If SRCLK (Rising edge) is triggered, voltage level will be placed into the register (All bits will be shifted to the right)

RCLK will latch the data stored in shift register and it will be outputed

4 pins from MC needed and connected to shift register

One pin for SRCLR Bar
One pin for SER
One pin for SRCLK
One pin for RCLK
